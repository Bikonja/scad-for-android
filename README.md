scad-for-android
=================

A native Android app for SCAD (SChool ADministration) system made by Vsite.

**NOTICE:** Since SCAD doesn't expose any API, this app relies on mimicking a web user. This has two side-effects you should really know about.

1. When you do any action using this app, the SCAD system will think you are logged in using the web interface
2. Any change, even if it's not even noticeable in the web interface *may* break the functionality of this app. While these types of changes haven't been that frequent in the past, I can not guarantee if and when a change like this happens and how it will affect this app.

This project will be on GitHub and licensed under the GPLv3 license. If anything changes in SCAD that breaks the app, you can download the source code and fix the app. If you do that, consider forking this project and creating a pull request.
On that same note, while I'm working actively on this project (until I get my diploma for which this project is for) I will fix bugs and add features. After I graduate, I will likely stop my work on this project, but will leave it on GitHub so if someone wants to take it over, as long as you follow the license, you're free to do so.
